requirements = """### Requirements Analysis for the \"schools\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"schools\" table is designed to store comprehensive information about schools, including their identification codes, contact details, operational status, and other relevant attributes. This table serves as a central repository for school-related data, which can be referenced by other tables such as \"frpm\" and \"satscores\" to maintain data integrity and consistency across the database.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each school must have a unique identifier, `CDSCode`, which serves as the primary key. This ensures that each school can be uniquely identified and referenced by other tables.\n\n2. **Basic Information**:\n   - The table must store essential details about each school, including its name (`School`), district (`District`), and county (`County`). These fields are crucial for identifying and categorizing schools.\n\n3. **Location Details**:\n   - The table should capture both physical and mailing addresses, including street, city, zip code, and state. This information is necessary for correspondence and geographical analysis.\n\n4. **Operational Status**:\n   - Fields such as `StatusType`, `OpenDate`, and `ClosedDate` are required to track the operational status of each school. This helps in understanding whether a school is currently active or has been closed.\n\n5. **Charter Information**:\n   - The table must include details about charter status (`Charter`), charter number (`CharterNum`), and funding type (`FundingType`). This information is important for distinguishing between different types of schools and their funding mechanisms.\n\n6. **Administrative Contacts**:\n   - The table should store contact information for up to three administrators, including their first names, last names, and email addresses. This ensures that there are multiple points of contact for each school.\n\n7. **Geographical Coordinates**:\n   - Latitude and longitude fields are required to store the geographical coordinates of each school. This is useful for mapping and spatial analysis.\n\n8. **Special Characteristics**:\n   - Fields such as `Virtual`, `Magnet`, `GSoffered`, and `GSserved` are needed to capture special characteristics of schools, such as whether they offer virtual learning or are magnet schools.\n\n9. **Last Update Timestamp**:\n   - The `LastUpdate` field is necessary to track the last time the record was updated. This helps in maintaining the accuracy and currency of the data.\n\n10. **Foreign Key Relationships**:\n    - The `CDSCode` field must be referenced by other tables (e.g., `frpm`, `satscores`) to ensure referential integrity. This allows for consistent and reliable data linkage across the database.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Ensure that all mandatory fields are populated correctly and that the primary key (`CDSCode`) is unique and not null.\n\n2. **Performance**:\n   - Optimize the table for efficient querying, especially for operations that join this table with others based on the `CDSCode`.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of records, as it will store data for all schools within the jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Security**:\n   - Implement appropriate access controls to protect sensitive information, such as administrator contact details.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"schools\" table will effectively serve its purpose as a central repository for school-related data, supporting various analytical and operational needs within the database system."""
