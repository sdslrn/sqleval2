        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for `frpm` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `frpm` table is designed to store data related to the Free and Reduced-Price Meal (FRPM) program for schools. This data is essential for tracking and analyzing the eligibility and participation rates of students in the FRPM program across different schools, districts, and counties.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Primary Key:**\n   - The table must have a unique identifier for each record, which is the `CDSCode`. This code uniquely identifies each school and is used as the primary key.\n\n2. **Academic Year:**\n   - The table should include the academic year for which the data is relevant. This allows for temporal analysis and comparison across different years.\n\n3. **Geographical Information:**\n   - The table must capture the hierarchical geographical information including `County Code`, `District Code`, and `School Code`.\n   - It should also store the names of the county, district, and school (`County Name`, `District Name`, `School Name`).\n\n4. **School Characteristics:**\n   - The table should include information about the type of district and school (`District Type`, `School Type`), as well as the educational options available (`Educational Option Type`).\n   - Charter school status and details should be captured (`Charter School (Y/N)`, `Charter School Number`, `Charter Funding Type`).\n\n5. **Enrollment and Meal Counts:**\n   - The table must store enrollment numbers for different age groups (`Enrollment (K-12)`, `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`).\n   - It should also capture the counts of students eligible for free meals and FRPM (`Free Meal Count (K-12)`, `FRPM Count (K-12)`, `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)`, `FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)`).\n\n6. **Eligibility Percentages:**\n   - The table should include the percentage of students eligible for free meals and FRPM for different age groups (`Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)`, `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)`, `Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)`, `Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (Ages 5-17)`).\n\n7. **Additional Attributes:**\n   - The table should capture the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) provision status (`NSLP Provision Status`).\n   - It should include the low and high grades offered by the school (`Low Grade`, `High Grade`).\n   - The table must store the IRC (Income Reporting Code) and the CALPADS (California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System) Fall 1 Certification Status.\n\n8. **Data Integrity and Relationships:**\n   - The `CDSCode` must be a foreign key referencing the `schools` table to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n   - The table should enforce not null constraints where necessary to ensure critical data is always captured.\n\n9. **Nullability:**\n   - Fields that are not always available or applicable should allow null values to accommodate incomplete data entries.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Performance:**\n   - The table should be optimized for read-heavy operations as it will be frequently queried for reporting and analysis purposes.\n\n2. **Scalability:**\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large volume of records, considering the number of schools and the annual data accumulation.\n\n3. **Security:**\n   - Access to the table should be restricted to authorized users to protect sensitive student information.\n\n4. **Compliance:**\n   - The table must comply with relevant data protection regulations and standards, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of student data.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `frpm` table will effectively support the tracking and analysis of the Free and Reduced-Price Meal program, providing valuable insights for educational authorities and policymakers.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for `satscores` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `satscores` table is designed to store and manage data related to SAT scores for various schools. This table will be used to track the performance of students in different schools based on their SAT scores, which can be utilized for educational assessments, reporting, and analysis.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Data Integrity and Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that each record in the `satscores` table is uniquely identified by the `cds` (County-District-School code) which serves as the primary key.\n   - Maintain referential integrity by ensuring that the `cds` field references a valid `CDSCode` in the `schools` table.\n\n2. **Data Fields:**\n   - **School Identification:**\n     - `cds`: Unique identifier for each school, ensuring linkage to the `schools` table.\n     - `rtype`: Type of record, indicating the nature of the data (e.g., school, district, county).\n     - `sname`, `dname`, `cname`: Names of the school, district, and county respectively, for easy identification and reporting.\n\n   - **Enrollment and Participation:**\n     - `enroll12`: Number of students enrolled in the 12th grade, providing context for the number of test takers.\n     - `NumTstTakr`: Number of students who took the SAT, essential for calculating participation rates and average scores.\n\n   - **SAT Scores:**\n     - `AvgScrRead`, `AvgScrMath`, `AvgScrWrite`: Average scores in Reading, Math, and Writing sections of the SAT, used for performance analysis.\n     - `NumGE1500`: Number of students scoring 1500 or above, indicating high performance.\n\n3. **Performance Metrics:**\n   - The table should support the calculation of various performance metrics, such as average scores and the percentage of students scoring above a certain threshold (e.g., 1500).\n\n4. **Data Quality:**\n   - Ensure that all numeric fields (e.g., `enroll12`, `NumTstTakr`, `AvgScrRead`, `AvgScrMath`, `AvgScrWrite`, `NumGE1500`) are validated for appropriate ranges and data types.\n   - Handle null values appropriately, especially in optional fields, to avoid data inconsistencies.\n\n5. **Reporting and Analysis:**\n   - The table should facilitate easy extraction and aggregation of data for reporting purposes, such as generating performance reports by school, district, or county.\n   - Support queries that combine SAT scores with other educational data from related tables (e.g., `schools`, `frpm`) for comprehensive analysis.\n\n6. **Scalability and Performance:**\n   - Design the table to handle a large volume of records efficiently, considering the potential number of schools and students.\n   - Optimize for query performance, especially for common operations like filtering by school, district, or county, and calculating averages and totals.\n\n7. **Security and Access Control:**\n   - Implement appropriate access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view or modify the data in the `satscores` table.\n   - Protect sensitive student performance data from unauthorized access and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `satscores` table will effectively support the storage, management, and analysis of SAT score data, contributing to the overall educational assessment and improvement efforts.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"schools\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"schools\" table is designed to store comprehensive information about schools, including their identification codes, contact details, operational status, and other relevant attributes. This table serves as a central repository for school-related data, which can be referenced by other tables such as \"frpm\" and \"satscores\" to maintain data integrity and consistency across the database.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each school must have a unique identifier, `CDSCode`, which serves as the primary key. This ensures that each school can be uniquely identified and referenced by other tables.\n\n2. **Basic Information**:\n   - The table must store essential details about each school, including its name (`School`), district (`District`), and county (`County`). These fields are crucial for identifying and categorizing schools.\n\n3. **Location Details**:\n   - The table should capture both physical and mailing addresses, including street, city, zip code, and state. This information is necessary for correspondence and geographical analysis.\n\n4. **Operational Status**:\n   - Fields such as `StatusType`, `OpenDate`, and `ClosedDate` are required to track the operational status of each school. This helps in understanding whether a school is currently active or has been closed.\n\n5. **Charter Information**:\n   - The table must include details about charter status (`Charter`), charter number (`CharterNum`), and funding type (`FundingType`). This information is important for distinguishing between different types of schools and their funding mechanisms.\n\n6. **Administrative Contacts**:\n   - The table should store contact information for up to three administrators, including their first names, last names, and email addresses. This ensures that there are multiple points of contact for each school.\n\n7. **Geographical Coordinates**:\n   - Latitude and longitude fields are required to store the geographical coordinates of each school. This is useful for mapping and spatial analysis.\n\n8. **Special Characteristics**:\n   - Fields such as `Virtual`, `Magnet`, `GSoffered`, and `GSserved` are needed to capture special characteristics of schools, such as whether they offer virtual learning or are magnet schools.\n\n9. **Last Update Timestamp**:\n   - The `LastUpdate` field is necessary to track the last time the record was updated. This helps in maintaining the accuracy and currency of the data.\n\n10. **Foreign Key Relationships**:\n    - The `CDSCode` field must be referenced by other tables (e.g., `frpm`, `satscores`) to ensure referential integrity. This allows for consistent and reliable data linkage across the database.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Ensure that all mandatory fields are populated correctly and that the primary key (`CDSCode`) is unique and not null.\n\n2. **Performance**:\n   - Optimize the table for efficient querying, especially for operations that join this table with others based on the `CDSCode`.\n\n3. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of records, as it will store data for all schools within the jurisdiction.\n\n4. **Security**:\n   - Implement appropriate access controls to protect sensitive information, such as administrator contact details.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"schools\" table will effectively serve its purpose as a central repository for school-related data, supporting various analytical and operational needs within the database system.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for \"cards\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"cards\" table is designed to store comprehensive information about individual cards in a collectible card game database. This table serves as the central repository for card-specific data, facilitating various operations such as card retrieval, display, and management within the application.\n\n#### Functional Requirements:\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each card must have a unique identifier (`id`) that is auto-incremented.\n   - Each card must also have a universally unique identifier (`uuid`) to ensure global uniqueness across different systems.\n\n2. **Card Attributes**:\n   - The table must store various attributes related to the card, including but not limited to:\n     - Artist information (`artist`)\n     - Card name in ASCII format (`asciiName`)\n     - Availability status (`availability`)\n     - Border color (`borderColor`)\n     - Color identity and indicators (`colorIdentity`, `colorIndicator`)\n     - Mana cost and converted mana cost (`manaCost`, `convertedManaCost`)\n     - Card text and flavor text (`text`, `flavorText`)\n     - Card type and subtypes (`type`, `subtypes`)\n     - Power and toughness (`power`, `toughness`)\n     - Rarity (`rarity`)\n     - Set code (`setCode`)\n\n3. **Boolean Flags**:\n   - The table must include several boolean flags to indicate specific card properties, such as:\n     - Whether the card has a foil version (`hasFoil`)\n     - Whether the card is a reprint (`isReprint`)\n     - Whether the card is reserved (`isReserved`)\n     - Whether the card is available online only (`isOnlineOnly`)\n\n4. **External Identifiers**:\n   - The table must store external identifiers for integration with other systems, such as:\n     - Card Kingdom IDs (`cardKingdomId`, `cardKingdomFoilId`)\n     - MTG Arena ID (`mtgArenaId`)\n     - Scryfall IDs (`scryfallId`, `scryfallIllustrationId`, `scryfallOracleId`)\n     - TCGPlayer Product ID (`tcgplayerProductId`)\n\n5. **Textual Descriptions**:\n   - The table must accommodate various textual descriptions and metadata, including:\n     - Flavor name (`flavorName`)\n     - Original text and type (`originalText`, `originalType`)\n     - Purchase URLs (`purchaseUrls`)\n     - Keywords (`keywords`)\n\n6. **Relational Integrity**:\n   - The `uuid` field must be used to establish relationships with other tables, such as `foreign_data`, `legalities`, and `rulings`, ensuring referential integrity.\n\n7. **Default Values**:\n   - Certain fields must have default values to ensure data consistency, such as:\n     - `hasAlternativeDeckLimit`, `hasContentWarning`, `hasFoil`, `hasNonFoil`, `isAlternative`, `isFullArt`, `isOnlineOnly`, `isOversized`, `isPromo`, `isReprint`, `isReserved`, `isStarter`, `isStorySpotlight`, `isTextless`, `isTimeshifted` (all default to 0).\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n1. **Performance**:\n   - The table must be optimized for read-heavy operations, as card data will frequently be retrieved for display and analysis.\n\n2. **Scalability**:\n   - The table must support a large number of records, given the extensive and growing nature of the card database.\n\n3. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The table must enforce data integrity through constraints such as primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign key relationships.\n\n4. **Maintainability**:\n   - The table schema should be designed to accommodate future expansions, such as additional card attributes or new relationships with other tables.\n\n5. **Security**:\n   - Access to the table must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users can perform write operations, while read operations may be more broadly available.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"cards\" table will effectively serve as a robust and comprehensive repository for card data within the database, supporting various application functionalities and ensuring data integrity and performance.",

This table supports the multilingual capabilities of the card database, ensuring that users can access card information in various languages.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Localization Support**:\n   - The table must store translations of card names, text, and flavor text in multiple languages.\n   - Each entry should be associated with a specific language.\n\n2. **Card Association**:\n   - Each record in the `foreign_data` table must be linked to a specific card in the `cards` table via the `uuid` field.\n   - The `uuid` field must reference the `uuid` field in the `cards` table to ensure data integrity and consistency.\n\n3. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each entry in the `foreign_data` table must have a unique identifier (`id`) to distinguish between different translations and entries.\n\n4. **Multiverse ID**:\n   - The table should include a `multiverseid` field to store the unique identifier used by the official card database for the specific language version of the card.\n\n5. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The `uuid` field must enforce referential integrity by referencing the `uuid` field in the `cards` table.\n   - The foreign key constraint should ensure that any update or deletion of a card in the `cards` table cascades to the `foreign_data` table, maintaining consistency.\n\n6. **Text Fields**:\n   - The table must include fields for `flavorText`, `name`, `text`, and `type` to store the translated content.\n   - These fields should be capable of storing text in various languages, including special characters and diacritics.\n\n7. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - The table should be indexed appropriately to ensure efficient querying, especially for lookups based on `uuid` and `language`.\n\n8. **Scalability**:\n   - The design should accommodate a growing number of translations as new languages are added and as the card database expands.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Usability**:\n   - The table should be designed to facilitate easy retrieval and management of localized card data by developers and database administrators.\n\n2. **Security**:\n   - Access to the `foreign_data` table should be controlled to prevent unauthorized modifications, ensuring the integrity of the localized data.\n\n3. **Compliance**:\n   - The table should comply with relevant data protection regulations, especially when storing text in different languages that may include user-generated content.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `foreign_data` table will effectively support the multilingual needs of the card database, ensuring that users can access accurate and consistent card information in their preferred language.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for \"legalities\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"legalities\" table is designed to store information about the legal status of cards in various formats. This is essential for players, collectors, and tournament organizers to determine which cards are permissible in different gameplay formats.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Card Association**:\n   - Each entry in the \"legalities\" table must be associated with a specific card, identified by a unique UUID. This ensures that the legality status is correctly linked to the corresponding card.\n\n2. **Format Specification**:\n   - The table must include a field to specify the format (e.g., Standard, Modern, Commander) in which the card's legality is being described. This allows users to filter and query the legality status based on different formats.\n\n3. **Status Indication**:\n   - The table must include a field to indicate the status of the card in the specified format. Possible statuses include \"Legal,\" \"Banned,\" \"Restricted,\" etc. This provides clear information on whether a card can be used in a particular format.\n\n4. **Data Integrity and Consistency**:\n   - The UUID field must reference the \"cards\" table, ensuring referential integrity. Any updates or deletions in the \"cards\" table should cascade to maintain consistency.\n   - The format and status fields should have constraints to ensure valid entries (e.g., predefined list of formats and statuses).\n\n5. **Primary Key**:\n   - Each entry must have a unique identifier (id) to serve as the primary key. This ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and managed.\n\n6. **Maintenance and Updates**:\n   - The table should support efficient updates and deletions, particularly cascading updates/deletions from the \"cards\" table to ensure that the legality information remains accurate and up-to-date.\n\n7. **Query Performance**:\n   - The table should be optimized for querying by format and status, as users will frequently need to retrieve legality information based on these criteria.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of entries, as the database will grow with the addition of new cards and formats over time.\n\n2. **Performance**:\n   - The table should support fast read and write operations to ensure that legality information can be quickly retrieved and updated.\n\n3. **Security**:\n   - Access to modify the \"legalities\" table should be restricted to authorized users to prevent unauthorized changes to the legality status of cards.\n\n4. **Backup and Recovery**:\n   - The table should be included in regular backup and recovery plans to prevent data loss and ensure data integrity.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"legalities\" table will effectively serve its purpose of providing accurate and up-to-date information on the legal status of cards across various formats.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for \"rulings\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"rulings\" table is designed to store official rulings related to individual cards in the card database. These rulings provide clarifications, errata, or additional information about how a card should be interpreted or played within the game.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each ruling must have a unique identifier (`id`) to distinguish it from other rulings. This identifier should be auto-incremented to ensure uniqueness and ease of reference.\n\n2. **Card Association**:\n   - Each ruling must be associated with a specific card. This association is established through the `uuid` field, which references the unique identifier of a card in the \"cards\" table. This ensures that each ruling is linked to the correct card.\n\n3. **Ruling Details**:\n   - The table must store the text of the ruling (`text`). This field will contain the detailed explanation or clarification provided by the ruling.\n   - The date of the ruling (`date`) must be recorded to provide context on when the ruling was issued. This is important for understanding the timeline of changes or clarifications made to a card.\n\n4. **Referential Integrity**:\n   - The `uuid` field must enforce referential integrity by referencing the `uuid` field in the \"cards\" table. This ensures that every ruling is linked to a valid card.\n   - The foreign key constraint should include `ON UPDATE CASCADE` and `ON DELETE CASCADE` actions to maintain data consistency. If a card's `uuid` is updated or the card is deleted, the corresponding rulings should be updated or deleted automatically.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Performance**:\n   - The table should be indexed on the `uuid` field to optimize query performance when retrieving rulings for a specific card.\n\n2. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of rulings, as the database may grow significantly over time with the addition of new cards and rulings.\n\n3. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Ensure that the `date` field is properly validated to contain only valid date values.\n   - The `text` field should be capable of storing sufficiently long text entries to accommodate detailed rulings.\n\n4. **Usability**:\n   - The structure of the table should facilitate easy retrieval and display of rulings in user interfaces, ensuring that players and judges can quickly access the information they need.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"rulings\" table will effectively serve its purpose of storing and managing official rulings for cards, ensuring data integrity, and providing easy access to important game-related information.",

Each set represents a collection of cards released together, often with a common theme or storyline.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each set must have a unique identifier (`id`) to distinguish it from other sets.\n   - Each set must also have a unique code (`code`) that serves as an additional identifier, often used in external references and user interfaces.\n\n2. **Basic Information**:\n   - The table must store the name of the set (`name`), which is essential for display and user recognition.\n   - The `releaseDate` field is required to track when the set was officially released.\n\n3. **Set Composition**:\n   - The `baseSetSize` field is necessary to indicate the number of cards in the base set, excluding any promotional or special cards.\n   - The `totalSetSize` field should capture the total number of cards, including all variations and special editions.\n\n4. **Categorization and Grouping**:\n   - The `block` field is used to group sets that are part of a larger block or series.\n   - The `type` field categorizes the set (e.g., core set, expansion set).\n\n5. **Special Attributes**:\n   - Boolean fields such as `isFoilOnly`, `isForeignOnly`, `isNonFoilOnly`, `isOnlineOnly`, and `isPartialPreview` are required to indicate special characteristics of the set.\n   - The `keyruneCode` field is used to store a code representing the set's symbol or icon.\n\n6. **External References**:\n   - Fields like `mcmId`, `mcmIdExtras`, `mtgoCode`, and `tcgplayerGroupId` are necessary for integration with external systems and databases, providing cross-references to other platforms.\n\n7. **Parent-Child Relationships**:\n   - The `parentCode` field is used to link a set to its parent set, if applicable, indicating a hierarchical relationship between sets.\n\n8. **Localization**:\n   - The table must support multiple languages for set names and descriptions, which is facilitated through the `set_translations` table.\n\n#### Constraints and Relationships:\n- The `code` field must be unique to ensure no two sets share the same identifier.\n- The table must support referential integrity with the `set_translations` table, ensuring that translations are correctly linked to their respective sets.\n- The table should enforce constraints to ensure boolean fields default to `0` (false) when not specified.\n\n#### Performance Considerations:\n- Indexing on the `code` and `name` fields is recommended to optimize search and retrieval operations.\n- The table should be designed to handle a large number of records efficiently, as the database may contain information about many sets over time.\n\n#### Security and Data Integrity:\n- Ensure that all fields are validated for correct data types and formats.\n- Implement appropriate access controls to restrict unauthorized modifications to the set data.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"sets\" table will effectively support the management and retrieval of card set information within the database, ensuring data integrity, performance, and usability.",

This allows users to view set names in various languages, enhancing accessibility and user experience for a global audience.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Multilingual Support**:\n   - The table must support multiple languages for each card set, allowing users to view set names in their preferred language.\n\n2. **Referential Integrity**:\n   - Each translation must be linked to a valid set code from the `sets` table to ensure consistency and integrity of the data.\n\n3. **Unique Translations**:\n   - Each combination of `setCode` and `language` should be unique to prevent duplicate translations for the same set in the same language.\n\n4. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of translations as the number of sets and supported languages grows.\n\n5. **Data Consistency**:\n   - Ensure that updates or deletions in the `sets` table are cascaded to maintain consistency in the `set_translations` table.\n\n6. **Performance**:\n   - Optimize for quick retrieval of translations to ensure a smooth user experience, especially when displaying set names in different languages.\n\n#### Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Add Translation**:\n   - Ability to add a new translation for a set name in a specific language.\n\n2. **Update Translation**:\n   - Ability to update an existing translation if corrections or changes are needed.\n\n3. **Delete Translation**:\n   - Ability to delete a translation if it is no longer needed or if the set is removed.\n\n4. **Retrieve Translations**:\n   - Ability to retrieve translations based on set code and/or language for display purposes.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Ensure that all translations are accurate and correctly linked to the corresponding set codes.\n\n2. **Security**:\n   - Implement appropriate access controls to ensure that only authorized users can add, update, or delete translations.\n\n3. **Usability**:\n   - Ensure that the process of managing translations is user-friendly and intuitive for administrators.\n\n4. **Reliability**:\n   - Ensure high availability and reliability of the translation data to support continuous access by users.\n\n#### Constraints:\n\n1. **Database Constraints**:\n   - Enforce foreign key constraints to ensure that each `setCode` in the `set_translations` table exists in the `sets` table.\n   - Enforce unique constraints on the combination of `setCode` and `language` to prevent duplicate entries.\n\n2. **Default Values**:\n   - No default values are required for the `language` and `translation` fields as they must be explicitly provided.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n\n1. **Sets Table**:\n   - The `set_translations` table is dependent on the `sets` table for valid set codes.\n\n2. **Database Management System**:\n   - The implementation relies on the capabilities of the underlying DBMS to enforce constraints and support cascading updates/deletes.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `set_translations` table will effectively support multilingual translations for card set names, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and a positive user experience.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"badges\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"badges\" table is designed to store information about badges awarded to users within the system. Badges are typically used to recognize and reward user achievements, contributions, or milestones.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Primary Key:**\n   - Each badge must have a unique identifier (`Id`) to ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and referenced.\n\n2. **User Association:**\n   - The table must support an association with users through the `UserId` field, which links to the `users` table. This association should be optional, allowing for the possibility of badges that are not yet assigned to any user.\n\n3. **Badge Information:**\n   - The `Name` field should store the name of the badge. This field is optional to accommodate scenarios where the badge name might not be immediately available or applicable.\n\n4. **Date of Award:**\n   - The `Date` field should capture the date and time when the badge was awarded. This field is optional to allow for flexibility in recording the award date.\n\n5. **Referential Integrity:**\n   - The `UserId` field must maintain referential integrity with the `users` table. Any updates or deletions in the `users` table should cascade to ensure consistency. Specifically:\n     - **On Update Cascade:** If a user's `Id` is updated, the corresponding `UserId` in the `badges` table should automatically update to reflect this change.\n     - **On Delete Cascade:** If a user is deleted from the `users` table, all associated badges should also be deleted to maintain data integrity.\n\n6. **Optional Fields:**\n   - Both `UserId` and `Name` fields are optional, allowing for flexibility in the data model. This accommodates scenarios where a badge might be predefined but not yet assigned to a user or where the badge name is not immediately known.\n\n#### Constraints and Considerations:\n\n- **Data Consistency:**\n  - Ensure that the `UserId` values in the `badges` table always correspond to valid `Id` values in the `users` table.\n  \n- **Performance:**\n  - Indexing the `UserId` field may be beneficial for query performance, especially when retrieving badges for specific users.\n\n- **Scalability:**\n  - The table should be designed to handle a potentially large number of badges, given that users can earn multiple badges over time.\n\n- **Flexibility:**\n  - The optional nature of the `UserId` and `Name` fields provides flexibility in how badges are managed and assigned, supporting a variety of use cases and workflows.\n\n#### Summary:\nThe \"badges\" table is a crucial component for tracking user achievements within the system. It must support unique identification of each badge, optional association with users, and optional naming and dating of badges. Referential integrity with the `users` table is essential to maintain data consistency, and the design should accommodate scalability and performance considerations.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the `comments` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `comments` table is designed to store user-generated comments associated with posts in the system. It captures essential details about each comment, including its content, the user who made the comment, and the post it is related to.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Comment Identification:**\n   - Each comment must have a unique identifier (`Id`) to distinguish it from other comments.\n\n2. **Post Association:**\n   - Each comment should be linked to a specific post (`PostId`). This association is crucial for maintaining the context of the comment within the discussion thread.\n\n3. **User Association:**\n   - Comments should be associated with the user who created them (`UserId`). This linkage helps in tracking user activity and contributions.\n   - In cases where the user is not registered or chooses to remain anonymous, the `UserDisplayName` field should capture the display name provided by the commenter.\n\n4. **Content and Metadata:**\n   - The actual content of the comment should be stored in the `Text` field.\n   - The `Score` field should capture the community's evaluation of the comment, typically through upvotes or downvotes.\n   - The `CreationDate` field should record the date and time when the comment was created.\n\n5. **Referential Integrity:**\n   - The `PostId` field must reference the `Id` field in the `posts` table, ensuring that each comment is linked to a valid post.\n   - The `UserId` field must reference the `Id` field in the `users` table, ensuring that each comment is linked to a valid user.\n   - Both foreign key relationships should support cascading updates and deletions to maintain data integrity across the database.\n\n6. **Optional Fields:**\n   - The `UserId`, `PostId`, `Score`, `Text`, `CreationDate`, and `UserDisplayName` fields are nullable to accommodate scenarios where some information might not be available or applicable.\n\n#### Constraints and Considerations:\n\n- **Data Integrity:**\n  - Ensure that the `comments` table maintains referential integrity with the `posts` and `users` tables through foreign key constraints.\n  - Implement cascading updates and deletions to automatically reflect changes in related tables.\n\n- **Performance:**\n  - Indexing the `PostId` and `UserId` fields can improve query performance, especially for retrieving comments related to specific posts or users.\n\n- **Scalability:**\n  - The table should be designed to handle a large volume of comments, considering the potential growth of user interactions over time.\n\n- **User Experience:**\n  - Allowing null values for `UserId` and `UserDisplayName` provides flexibility for anonymous comments, enhancing user engagement.\n\n#### Summary:\nThe `comments` table is a critical component for capturing user interactions within the system. It must ensure robust associations with posts and users, maintain data integrity, and support efficient querying and scalability. The design should accommodate both registered and anonymous users, providing a flexible yet structured approach to managing comments.",

This includes questions, answers, and other types of posts. The table captures various attributes related to the post's content, metadata, and user interactions.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Post Identification and Typing:**\n   - Each post must have a unique identifier (Id) to distinguish it from other posts.\n   - The type of post (e.g., question, answer) must be identified using the PostTypeId.\n\n2. **Content and Metadata:**\n   - The body of the post must be stored in a text format (Body).\n   - Posts should have a title (Title) for easy identification and searchability.\n   - Tags associated with the post should be stored to facilitate categorization and search (Tags).\n\n3. **User Association:**\n   - Each post should be linked to the user who created it (OwnerUserId).\n   - The display name of the owner should be stored (OwnerDisplayName).\n   - If the post is edited, the user who last edited it should be recorded (LastEditorUserId) along with their display name (LastEditorDisplayName).\n\n4. **Date and Time Tracking:**\n   - The creation date of the post (CreationDate) must be recorded.\n   - The date of the last activity on the post (LastActivityDate) should be tracked.\n   - If the post is edited, the date of the last edit (LastEditDate) should be recorded.\n   - The date when the post was closed (ClosedDate) should be captured if applicable.\n   - If the post becomes community-owned, the date of this change (CommunityOwnedDate) should be recorded.\n\n5. **Interaction Metrics:**\n   - The score of the post (Score) should be tracked to reflect user votes.\n   - The number of views (ViewCount) should be recorded to measure engagement.\n   - The number of answers (AnswerCount) for questions should be tracked.\n   - The number of comments (CommentCount) should be recorded.\n   - The number of times the post is marked as a favorite (FavoriteCount) should be tracked.\n\n6. **Post Relationships:**\n   - If the post is an answer, it should reference the question it answers (ParentId).\n   - If the post is a question, it should reference the accepted answer (AcceptedAnswerId).\n\n7. **Data Integrity and Constraints:**\n   - The table must enforce referential integrity with the users table for user-related fields (OwnerUserId, LastEditorUserId).\n   - The table must enforce referential integrity with itself for parent-child post relationships (ParentId).\n   - All foreign key relationships should support cascading updates and deletions to maintain data consistency.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Performance:**\n   - The table should be indexed appropriately to ensure efficient querying, especially on frequently searched fields like Id, PostTypeId, OwnerUserId, and CreationDate.\n\n2. **Scalability:**\n   - The table design should support a large volume of posts without significant performance degradation.\n\n3. **Security:**\n   - Access to the table should be controlled to ensure that only authorized users can create, read, update, or delete posts.\n\n4. **Data Consistency:**\n   - Transactions involving the posts table should ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to maintain data integrity.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"posts\" table will effectively support the platform's functionality, ensuring robust data management and user interaction tracking.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the `Country` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `Country` table is designed to store information about countries that are relevant to the context of the database, which appears to be related to football (soccer) data. This table will serve as a reference for other tables, such as `League` and `Match`, to ensure data consistency and integrity.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each country must have a unique identifier (`id`) to distinguish it from other countries. This identifier will be used as a primary key.\n\n2. **Country Name**:\n   - The table must store the name of each country. The country name should be unique to prevent duplicate entries and ensure data integrity.\n\n3. **Referential Integrity**:\n   - The `Country` table will be referenced by other tables, such as `League` and `Match`. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain referential integrity to ensure that any country referenced in these tables exists in the `Country` table.\n\n4. **Data Consistency**:\n   - The country name should be consistent and standardized to avoid discrepancies. For example, the name should be stored in a consistent format (e.g., \"United States\" instead of \"USA\" or \"U.S.A.\").\n\n5. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - The table should be optimized for read operations, as it will frequently be queried to retrieve country information for leagues and matches.\n\n6. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to accommodate the addition of new countries without requiring significant changes to the database schema.\n\n#### Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Add Country**:\n   - The system must allow the addition of new countries to the `Country` table. Each new entry must have a unique `id` and a unique `name`.\n\n2. **Update Country**:\n   - The system must allow updates to the country name. However, such updates should ensure that the new name remains unique within the table.\n\n3. **Delete Country**:\n   - The system must allow the deletion of a country. Before deletion, the system should check for any dependencies in other tables (e.g., `League`, `Match`) to prevent orphaned records.\n\n4. **Retrieve Country Information**:\n   - The system must allow retrieval of country information based on the `id` or `name`. This functionality is essential for ensuring that other tables can reference valid country data.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Data Integrity**:\n   - Ensure that the `id` is auto-incremented and unique.\n   - Ensure that the `name` is unique and not null.\n\n2. **Security**:\n   - Implement access controls to restrict who can add, update, or delete country records to prevent unauthorized modifications.\n\n3. **Usability**:\n   - Provide clear error messages and validation feedback when adding or updating country records to guide users in maintaining data integrity.\n\n4. **Performance**:\n   - Optimize the table for quick read operations, as it will be frequently accessed by other tables.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `Country` table will effectively serve its purpose within the database, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and ease of use.",

This table will serve as a reference for other tables, such as \"Match,\" to link matches to their respective leagues.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each league must have a unique identifier (`id`) to ensure that each entry can be uniquely referenced.\n\n2. **Country Association**:\n   - Each league must be associated with a specific country. This relationship is established through a foreign key (`country_id`) that references the `Country` table. This ensures that the league is correctly linked to its country of origin.\n\n3. **League Name**:\n   - The name of the league (`name`) must be unique to prevent duplication and ensure clarity. This field will store the official name of the league.\n\n4. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The table must enforce referential integrity by ensuring that the `country_id` exists in the `Country` table. This prevents orphaned records and maintains consistency in the database.\n\n5. **Constraints**:\n   - The `name` field must be unique to avoid confusion between leagues with similar names.\n   - The `country_id` must be a valid reference to an existing entry in the `Country` table.\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - Indexing the `id` and `name` fields will be necessary to ensure quick lookups and maintain performance, especially when the table grows in size.\n\n7. **Scalability**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of leagues, considering the global nature of football and the potential for adding new leagues over time.\n\n8. **Usage**:\n   - The \"League\" table will be frequently joined with the \"Match\" table to retrieve league-specific match data.\n   - It will also be used in reporting and analytics to group and filter match data by league.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Security**:\n   - Access to modify the \"League\" table should be restricted to authorized users to prevent unauthorized changes.\n\n2. **Backup and Recovery**:\n   - Regular backups should be scheduled to prevent data loss. Recovery procedures must be in place to restore the table in case of data corruption or loss.\n\n3. **Compliance**:\n   - Ensure that the data stored complies with relevant data protection regulations, especially if the database is used in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"League\" table will effectively serve its purpose within the database, ensuring accurate and efficient storage and retrieval of league-related information.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"Match\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"Match\" table is designed to store comprehensive data about football matches, including details about the teams, players, match outcomes, and various in-game events and statistics. This table serves as a central repository for match-related information, facilitating analysis, reporting, and integration with other football-related data.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Match Identification:**\n   - Each match must have a unique identifier (`match_api_id`) to ensure distinct records.\n   - The primary key (`id`) should be auto-incremented to maintain unique entries.\n\n2. **Date and Time:**\n   - The date of the match (`date`) must be recorded to track when the match took place.\n   - The season (`season`) and stage (`stage`) of the match should be captured to contextualize the match within the competition timeline.\n\n3. **Teams Involved:**\n   - The table must store references to the home and away teams using their respective API IDs (`home_team_api_id`, `away_team_api_id`).\n   - These references should link to the `Team` table to ensure data integrity and enable detailed team analysis.\n\n4. **Match Outcome:**\n   - The number of goals scored by the home team (`home_team_goal`) and the away team (`away_team_goal`) must be recorded to determine the match result.\n\n5. **Player Participation:**\n   - The table should include references to the players who participated in the match, both for the home and away teams.\n   - Player positions (X1 to X11 and Y1 to Y11) should be recorded to capture the starting lineup and formation.\n   - These references should link to the `Player` table to ensure data integrity and enable detailed player performance analysis.\n\n6. **In-Game Events and Statistics:**\n   - Various in-game events such as goals (`goal`), shots on target (`shoton`), shots off target (`shotoff`), fouls committed (`foulcommit`), cards (`card`), crosses (`cross`), corners (`corner`), and possession (`possession`) should be recorded to provide a detailed account of the match.\n\n7. **Betting Odds:**\n   - The table should store betting odds from various bookmakers (e.g., B365, BW, IW, LB, PS, WH, SJ, VC, GB, BS) for home win (`H`), draw (`D`), and away win (`A`).\n   - These odds are essential for analyzing betting trends and market reactions to match outcomes.\n\n8. **Foreign Key Constraints:**\n   - The table must enforce foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity with the `Country`, `League`, `Team`, and `Player` tables.\n   - This ensures that all referenced data is valid and consistent across the database.\n\n9. **Data Consistency and Integrity:**\n   - The table should enforce data types and constraints to maintain data consistency (e.g., INTEGER for numerical values, TEXT for descriptive fields).\n   - Unique constraints on fields like `match_api_id` should be enforced to prevent duplicate entries.\n\n10. **Scalability and Performance:**\n    - The table design should consider scalability to handle a large volume of match data efficiently.\n    - Indexing on key fields (e.g., `match_api_id`, `date`, `home_team_api_id`, `away_team_api_id`) should be implemented to optimize query performance.\n\n#### Summary:\nThe \"Match\" table is a critical component of the database, capturing detailed information about football matches, including team and player participation, match outcomes, in-game events, and betting odds. Ensuring data integrity, consistency, and scalability are paramount to support comprehensive analysis and reporting.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for Player_Attributes Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `Player_Attributes` table is designed to store detailed performance and skill metrics for individual players over time. This data is essential for evaluating player capabilities, tracking their development, and making informed decisions in team management and player scouting.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Player Identification:**\n   - The table must uniquely identify each player using `player_fifa_api_id` and `player_api_id`, which are foreign keys referencing the `Player` table. This ensures that each attribute record is associated with a valid player.\n\n2. **Temporal Tracking:**\n   - The `date` field is required to record the specific date when the attributes were measured or updated. This allows for historical tracking of a player's performance over time.\n\n3. **Performance Metrics:**\n   - The table must capture a comprehensive set of performance metrics, including but not limited to overall rating, potential, and various skill ratings (e.g., crossing, finishing, dribbling). These metrics are crucial for assessing a player's abilities in different aspects of the game.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes:**\n   - Physical attributes such as acceleration, sprint speed, agility, and strength must be recorded. These attributes are important for understanding a player's physical capabilities and fitness.\n\n5. **Positional Skills:**\n   - The table should include specific skills relevant to different positions, such as defensive work rate, attacking work rate, and goalkeeping skills (e.g., gk_diving, gk_handling). This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of players in various roles.\n\n6. **Consistency and Data Integrity:**\n   - The table must enforce data integrity by ensuring that all foreign key references to the `Player` table are valid. This prevents orphaned records and maintains consistency across the database.\n\n7. **Scalability:**\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large volume of records, as it will store multiple attribute entries for each player over time. Efficient indexing and data retrieval mechanisms are necessary to support this scalability.\n\n8. **Data Analysis and Reporting:**\n   - The structure of the table should facilitate easy querying and analysis of player attributes. This includes the ability to generate reports on player performance trends, compare players, and identify top performers based on specific metrics.\n\n9. **User Accessibility:**\n   - The data stored in the `Player_Attributes` table should be accessible to various stakeholders, including coaches, analysts, and scouts. Appropriate access controls and user interfaces should be implemented to ensure that users can retrieve and analyze the data as needed.\n\n10. **Historical Data Preservation:**\n    - The table must support the preservation of historical data to allow for longitudinal studies and trend analysis. This includes maintaining records even after players retire or transfer to different teams.\n\nBy meeting these requirements, the `Player_Attributes` table will serve as a robust and comprehensive repository for player performance data, supporting various analytical and decision-making processes within the organization.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"Team\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"Team\" table is designed to store essential information about football teams. This data is crucial for identifying teams, linking them to their respective attributes, and associating them with matches and leagues.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each team must have a unique identifier (`id`) to ensure distinct records.\n   - The `team_api_id` and `team_fifa_api_id` should also be unique to maintain consistency with external systems and APIs.\n\n2. **Team Information**:\n   - The table must store both the long and short names of the teams (`team_long_name` and `team_short_name`). This is essential for display purposes in various contexts, such as user interfaces and reports.\n\n3. **Integration with External Systems**:\n   - The `team_api_id` and `team_fifa_api_id` fields are necessary to link the team data with external APIs and systems, ensuring seamless data integration and updates.\n\n4. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The table must enforce uniqueness constraints on `team_api_id` and `team_fifa_api_id` to prevent duplicate entries and ensure data integrity.\n   - Foreign key constraints should be in place to maintain referential integrity with related tables, such as `Team_Attributes` and `Match`.\n\n5. **Scalability and Performance**:\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of records efficiently, considering the potential growth in the number of teams over time.\n   - Indexing on key fields like `team_api_id` and `team_fifa_api_id` is necessary to optimize query performance.\n\n6. **Compliance and Standards**:\n   - The table structure should comply with relevant data standards and best practices for database design, ensuring compatibility with other systems and ease of maintenance.\n\n7. **Historical Data**:\n   - The table should support the storage of historical data, allowing for the tracking of changes in team names or identifiers over time.\n\n8. **User Accessibility**:\n   - The data stored in the table should be easily accessible and retrievable by users and applications, supporting various use cases such as team management, match scheduling, and statistical analysis.\n\n#### Dependencies:\n- The `Team` table is dependent on the `Team_Attributes` and `Match` tables for storing detailed attributes and match-related data, respectively.\n- It must maintain foreign key relationships with these tables to ensure data consistency and integrity.\n\n#### Security and Privacy:\n- Access to the `Team` table should be controlled through appropriate database permissions to ensure that only authorized users can view or modify the data.\n- Sensitive information, if any, should be protected according to the organization's data security policies.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the \"Team\" table will effectively support the management and utilization of team-related data within the database, ensuring robust and reliable operations.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"account\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"account\" table is designed to store information about bank accounts. Each record in this table represents a unique bank account, including details about its associated district, frequency of transactions, and the date the account was created.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each account must have a unique identifier (`account_id`). This is crucial for distinguishing between different accounts and for establishing relationships with other tables.\n\n2. **District Association**:\n   - Each account must be associated with a specific district (`district_id`). This linkage is essential for regional analysis and reporting, and it must reference a valid district in the `district` table.\n\n3. **Transaction Frequency**:\n   - The table must capture the frequency of transactions (`frequency`) for each account. This information is vital for understanding account activity patterns and customer behavior.\n\n4. **Creation Date**:\n   - The date when the account was created (`date`) must be recorded. This is important for tracking the account's age and for historical data analysis.\n\n5. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The `account_id` must be unique and not null to ensure each account can be individually identified.\n   - The `district_id` must not be null and must reference an existing `district_id` in the `district` table to maintain referential integrity.\n   - The `frequency` field must not be null to ensure that transaction frequency data is always available.\n   - The `date` field must not be null to ensure that the creation date of the account is always recorded.\n\n6. **Default Values**:\n   - The `account_id` and `district_id` fields have default values of 0. This implies that these fields should be explicitly set during account creation to avoid defaulting to 0, which may not be meaningful.\n\n#### Relationships:\n- The `account` table has a foreign key relationship with the `district` table through the `district_id` field. This relationship ensures that each account is linked to a valid district.\n\n#### Constraints:\n- Primary Key: `account_id` ensures that each account record is unique.\n- Foreign Key: `district_id` references `district(district_id)` to maintain referential integrity between accounts and districts.\n\n#### Usage Scenarios:\n- **Account Management**: The table will be used by banking applications to manage and retrieve account details.\n- **Reporting and Analysis**: Financial analysts will use the data to generate reports on account distribution across districts, transaction frequencies, and account creation trends.\n- **Customer Service**: Customer service representatives will access this table to provide information and support related to specific accounts.\n\n#### Performance Considerations:\n- Indexing on `account_id` and `district_id` may be necessary to ensure efficient query performance, especially for operations involving joins with the `district` table or searches based on these fields.\n\n#### Security and Privacy:\n- Access to the `account` table should be restricted to authorized personnel only, given the sensitive nature of the data.\n- Proper encryption and data masking techniques should be employed to protect sensitive information.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `account` table will effectively support the bank's operational, analytical, and customer service needs while ensuring data integrity and security.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the `card` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `card` table is designed to store information about the various cards issued to clients. Each card is associated with a specific account and client through the `disp` table, which links clients to accounts.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Card Identification:**\n   - Each card must have a unique identifier (`card_id`) to distinguish it from other cards in the system.\n\n2. **Cardholder Association:**\n   - The card must be linked to a specific client and account through the `disp` table. This is achieved by the `disp_id` foreign key, ensuring that each card is associated with a valid client-account relationship.\n\n3. **Card Type:**\n   - The type of card (e.g., credit, debit) must be recorded. This is essential for categorizing the card and determining its usage and applicable rules.\n\n4. **Issuance Date:**\n   - The date when the card was issued must be captured. This is important for tracking the card's validity period, expiration, and for auditing purposes.\n\n#### Constraints and Relationships:\n\n1. **Primary Key Constraint:**\n   - `card_id` serves as the primary key, ensuring that each card record is unique and can be referenced unambiguously.\n\n2. **Foreign Key Constraint:**\n   - `disp_id` is a foreign key that references the `disp` table. This enforces referential integrity, ensuring that each card is linked to an existing client-account relationship.\n\n3. **Non-null Constraints:**\n   - All fields (`card_id`, `disp_id`, `type`, `issued`) are mandatory and must not be null. This ensures that all necessary information about the card is always provided.\n\n#### Data Integrity and Validation:\n\n1. **Unique Identification:**\n   - The system must ensure that `card_id` is unique across all records to prevent duplication.\n\n2. **Valid Client-Account Link:**\n   - The `disp_id` must correspond to an existing record in the `disp` table, ensuring that the card is always associated with a valid client-account relationship.\n\n3. **Card Type Validation:**\n   - The `type` field should be validated against a predefined set of card types to ensure consistency and prevent invalid entries.\n\n4. **Issuance Date Validation:**\n   - The `issued` date should be checked to ensure it is a valid date and logically consistent (e.g., not a future date).\n\n#### Usage Scenarios:\n\n1. **Card Issuance:**\n   - When a new card is issued, a record is created in the `card` table with the appropriate `disp_id`, `type`, and `issued` date.\n\n2. **Card Management:**\n   - The `card` table can be queried to manage and track the status of cards, including identifying active cards, expired cards, and the types of cards issued to clients.\n\n3. **Auditing and Reporting:**\n   - The `card` table provides essential data for auditing purposes, such as tracking issuance dates and types of cards issued over time.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `card` table will effectively support the management and tracking of cards within the database, ensuring data integrity and facilitating various operational and reporting needs.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for `disp` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `disp` table is designed to manage the relationships between clients and their accounts. It serves as a linkage table that connects clients to their respective accounts and specifies the type of relationship each client has with the account.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Client-Account Relationship Management:**\n   - The table must store information about which clients are associated with which accounts.\n   - Each record should clearly define the type of relationship (e.g., owner, authorized user) a client has with an account.\n\n2. **Data Integrity:**\n   - Ensure that each `disp` record references valid `client_id` and `account_id` values that exist in the `client` and `account` tables, respectively.\n   - Enforce referential integrity through foreign key constraints to prevent orphaned records.\n\n3. **Uniqueness and Identification:**\n   - Each record in the `disp` table must have a unique identifier (`disp_id`) to distinguish it from other records.\n   - The combination of `client_id` and `account_id` should be unique to prevent duplicate relationships between the same client and account.\n\n4. **Relationship Type Specification:**\n   - The table must include a field to specify the type of relationship (`type`) between the client and the account. This field should be mandatory and clearly defined.\n\n5. **Scalability and Performance:**\n   - The table should be designed to handle a large number of records efficiently, as each client can have multiple accounts and each account can have multiple clients.\n   - Indexing on `client_id` and `account_id` should be considered to optimize query performance.\n\n6. **Compliance and Security:**\n   - Ensure that the data stored in the `disp` table complies with relevant data protection regulations.\n   - Implement appropriate access controls to protect sensitive information about client-account relationships.\n\n#### Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Create Relationship:**\n   - Ability to add a new relationship between a client and an account, specifying the type of relationship.\n\n2. **Read Relationship:**\n   - Ability to retrieve information about the relationships between clients and accounts, including the type of relationship.\n\n3. **Update Relationship:**\n   - Ability to update the type of relationship between a client and an account.\n\n4. **Delete Relationship:**\n   - Ability to remove a relationship between a client and an account, ensuring that the deletion does not violate referential integrity.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Performance:**\n   - The system should handle queries involving the `disp` table with minimal latency, even as the number of records grows.\n\n2. **Reliability:**\n   - The `disp` table should maintain high availability and data integrity, ensuring that relationships are accurately represented at all times.\n\n3. **Scalability:**\n   - The table should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate an increasing number of clients and accounts without significant performance degradation.\n\n4. **Security:**\n   - Access to the `disp` table should be restricted to authorized personnel only, with audit trails to track changes to the data.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `disp` table will effectively manage the relationships between clients and accounts, ensuring data integrity, performance, and security.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the \"district\" Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe \"district\" table is designed to store detailed information about various districts. This information is crucial for categorizing and analyzing data related to clients, accounts, and other entities that are associated with specific geographical regions.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Unique Identification**:\n   - Each district must have a unique identifier (`district_id`) to ensure that each district can be distinctly recognized and referenced in the database.\n\n2. **Descriptive Attributes**:\n   - The table must include several descriptive attributes (A2 to A7) that provide textual information about the district. These attributes could represent names, types, or other qualitative data relevant to the district.\n\n3. **Quantitative Metrics**:\n   - The table must store various quantitative metrics (A8 to A16) that provide numerical data about the district. These metrics could include population statistics, economic indicators, or other measurable attributes.\n\n4. **Data Integrity**:\n   - The `district_id` must be a primary key to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of each district record.\n   - The table must enforce `NOT NULL` constraints on all fields except for A12 and A15, ensuring that essential data is always present.\n\n5. **Foreign Key Relationships**:\n   - The `district_id` must be referenced by other tables (e.g., `account`, `client`) to establish relationships between districts and other entities in the database. This ensures that data can be accurately linked and queried across different tables.\n\n6. **Scalability**:\n   - The table must be designed to accommodate a potentially large number of districts, ensuring that the database can scale as the number of districts grows.\n\n7. **Performance**:\n   - The table must be optimized for performance, particularly for queries that join the `district` table with other tables (e.g., `account`, `client`). Indexing on `district_id` and other frequently queried fields should be considered.\n\n8. **Data Consistency**:\n   - The table must ensure consistency in the data types and formats of its fields. For example, all textual fields should have a consistent character set and collation, and all numerical fields should have appropriate data types to handle the expected range of values.\n\n9. **Flexibility**:\n   - The table must be flexible enough to accommodate future changes or additions to the district attributes without requiring significant redesign. This could involve using generic field names (e.g., A2, A3) that can be repurposed as needed.\n\n10. **Documentation**:\n    - Comprehensive documentation must be provided for each field in the table, explaining its purpose, data type, constraints, and any relevant business rules. This ensures that developers and analysts can understand and use the table effectively.\n\n#### Summary:\nThe \"district\" table is a critical component of the database, providing essential geographical and statistical data that supports various business processes and analyses. Its design must ensure data integrity, scalability, performance, and flexibility, while maintaining clear and consistent documentation for all its attributes.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the Loan Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `loan` table is designed to store information about loans associated with accounts in the banking system. This table is crucial for managing and tracking loan details, including the amount, duration, payment schedule, and status of each loan.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Loan Identification:**\n   - Each loan must have a unique identifier (`loan_id`) to distinguish it from other loans.\n\n2. **Account Association:**\n   - Each loan must be linked to a specific account (`account_id`). This association is essential for tracking which account holds the loan and for integrating loan data with other account-related information.\n\n3. **Loan Details:**\n   - The table must capture the date the loan was issued (`date`), the total amount of the loan (`amount`), the duration of the loan in months (`duration`), and the regular payment amount (`payments`).\n\n4. **Loan Status:**\n   - The current status of the loan (`status`) must be recorded. This could include statuses such as 'approved', 'pending', 'repaid', or 'defaulted'.\n\n5. **Data Integrity:**\n   - The `account_id` must reference a valid account in the `account` table to ensure referential integrity.\n   - The `loan_id` must be unique and not null to ensure each loan can be individually identified and managed.\n\n6. **Default Values:**\n   - The `loan_id` should have a default value of 0, ensuring that a value is always present even if not explicitly provided.\n\n7. **Constraints:**\n   - The `loan_id` should be the primary key to ensure each record is unique.\n   - The `account_id` should be a foreign key referencing the `account` table to maintain the relationship between loans and accounts.\n\n8. **Data Types:**\n   - The `loan_id` and `account_id` should be integers.\n   - The `date` should be stored in a date format.\n   - The `amount` and `payments` should be stored as numeric values, with `amount` being an integer and `payments` being a real number to accommodate decimal values.\n   - The `status` should be stored as text to allow for various status descriptions.\n\n#### Usage Scenarios:\n- **Loan Management:**\n  - Bank staff can use this table to manage and monitor the status of loans, ensuring timely payments and identifying any overdue or defaulted loans.\n  \n- **Customer Service:**\n  - Customer service representatives can access loan details to assist customers with inquiries about their loan status, payment schedules, and outstanding balances.\n\n- **Financial Reporting:**\n  - The table can be used to generate reports on the total loan amounts issued, the number of active loans, and the overall financial health of the loan portfolio.\n\n#### Security and Privacy:\n- Access to the `loan` table should be restricted to authorized personnel to protect sensitive financial information.\n- Regular audits should be conducted to ensure data integrity and compliance with financial regulations.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `loan` table will effectively support the management and tracking of loans within the banking system, ensuring accurate and reliable financial operations.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the `order` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `order` table is designed to store information about financial orders associated with accounts. These orders represent transactions where funds are transferred from one account to another, either within the same bank or to an external bank.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Primary Key:**\n   - Each order must have a unique identifier (`order_id`) to ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and referenced.\n\n2. **Account Association:**\n   - Each order must be linked to an account (`account_id`). This association is crucial for tracking which account initiated the order.\n   - The `account_id` must reference a valid account in the `account` table, ensuring referential integrity.\n\n3. **Recipient Information:**\n   - The table must store the recipient bank's name (`bank_to`) and the recipient account number (`account_to`). This information is essential for directing the funds to the correct destination.\n\n4. **Transaction Details:**\n   - The amount of money being transferred (`amount`) must be recorded. This field is critical for financial tracking and auditing purposes.\n   - The `k_symbol` field should capture the purpose or category of the transaction, providing additional context for the order.\n\n5. **Data Integrity and Constraints:**\n   - The `order_id` must be unique and not null to serve as the primary key.\n   - The `account_id` must not be null and must reference an existing account in the `account` table.\n   - The `bank_to`, `account_to`, `amount`, and `k_symbol` fields must not be null to ensure that all necessary information for processing the order is available.\n\n6. **Foreign Key Constraints:**\n   - The `account_id` field must have a foreign key constraint referencing the `account` table to maintain referential integrity and ensure that orders are only associated with valid accounts.\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements:\n\n1. **Performance:**\n   - The table should be indexed on `order_id` and `account_id` to optimize query performance, especially for lookups and joins involving these fields.\n\n2. **Security:**\n   - Access to the `order` table should be restricted to authorized users only, given the sensitive nature of financial transactions.\n   - Data encryption should be considered for fields containing sensitive information, such as `account_to` and `amount`.\n\n3. **Scalability:**\n   - The table should be designed to handle a high volume of transactions, ensuring that performance remains efficient as the number of records grows.\n\n4. **Auditability:**\n   - Changes to the `order` table should be logged to provide an audit trail for financial transactions, aiding in compliance and fraud detection efforts.\n\nBy adhering to these requirements, the `order` table will effectively support the management and tracking of financial orders within the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.",

        "requirement": "### Requirements Analysis for the `trans` Table\n\n#### Purpose:\nThe `trans` table is designed to store transaction records for accounts within the banking system. Each record represents a financial transaction associated with a specific account, capturing essential details such as the transaction type, date, amount, and balance after the transaction.\n\n#### Key Requirements:\n\n1. **Transaction Identification:**\n   - Each transaction must have a unique identifier (`trans_id`) to ensure distinct records and facilitate easy referencing and retrieval.\n\n2. **Account Association:**\n   - Transactions must be linked to a specific account (`account_id`). This association is crucial for tracking all transactions related to a particular account and maintaining the integrity of account histories.\n\n3. **Transaction Details:**\n   - The table must capture the date of the transaction (`date`), which is essential for chronological tracking and reporting.\n   - The type of transaction (`type`) must be recorded to distinguish between different kinds of financial activities (e.g., deposit, withdrawal).\n   - The amount involved in the transaction (`amount`) must be documented to reflect the financial impact on the account.\n   - The balance after the transaction (`balance`) must be recorded to provide a running total of the account's funds.\n\n4. **Optional Transaction Attributes:**\n   - The operation type (`operation`), if applicable, should be recorded to provide additional context about the transaction (e.g., credit, debit).\n   - The `k_symbol` field should capture any specific symbols or codes associated with the transaction, which can be used for categorization or further analysis.\n   - The `bank` and `account` fields should store information about the external bank and account involved in the transaction, if applicable, to provide a complete picture of inter-bank transactions.\n\n5. **Data Integrity and Relationships:**\n   - The `account_id` must reference a valid account in the `account` table to ensure that all transactions are associated with existing accounts.\n   - The table must enforce data integrity by ensuring that all required fields (e.g., `trans_id`, `account_id`, `date`, `type`, `amount`, `balance`) are not null, except for optional fields that can be null.\n\n6. **Performance and Scalability:**\n   - The table should be optimized for performance, considering the potentially high volume of transactions. Indexing on key fields such as `trans_id` and `account_id` may be necessary to ensure efficient querying and reporting.\n\n7. **Compliance and Auditing:**\n   - The table must support compliance with financial regulations and auditing requirements. This includes maintaining accurate and complete records of all transactions and ensuring that data can be audited and traced back to the original entries.\n\n#### Summary:\nThe `trans` table is a critical component of the banking database, designed to accurately and efficiently record all financial transactions associated with accounts. It must ensure data integrity, support detailed transaction tracking, and comply with regulatory requirements while being optimized for performance and scalability.",
